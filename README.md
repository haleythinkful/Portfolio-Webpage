 <p align="center"> During and After graduating college, I began developing more of my skills and learning more programming languages through Treehouse. I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript so far! I'm really excited and grateful in hopefully becomming a thinkful student. As a thinkful student, I will have begun my journey in becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier! If you're looking to hire a new Web Designer and Software Developer please reach out! I am so excited to work with other designers and developers to build wonderful websites and great software.
